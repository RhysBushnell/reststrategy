# strategy-rest-seeder 

> WIP

Executes a series of instructions against an endpoint using a specified authentication on a given strategy.


## Problem space

Often we are faced with external products/services either self-hosted or SaaS where they require some level of configuration this often happens at CI (deploy) time, or on continous basis 

## Strategy 

Strategy is a setting against which to perform one or more rest calls to ensure an idempotent update.

### `GET/POST`



"FIND/POST"
"PUT/POST"
"GET/PUT/POST"
"FIND/PUT/POST"
"FIND/DELETE"
"FIND/DELETE/POST"
"PUT"
